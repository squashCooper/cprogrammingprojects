This is a collection of programs that I have written in C, most will have a project report called report.pdf 
that have a description of the program, its purpose and importance, how to use the program, and detailed pseudocode. 
The purpose of these reports is to instruct someone with little programming experience how to build the program from the ground up. 
They are made to be readable by everyone of different skill levels and use accesible language. 

Projects featured:
* Huffman Compression and Decompression
* Colorblind image generator
* Sorting algorithms
* Hexdump
* Hangman
